In ARTSTUDI 147: Art Book Object, I learned bookbinding techniques including how to make accordian books, hand sewn signatures, and hard bound books. Every book was made from scratch!

## Hard Bound Book: *The Evolution of Typography*
The content of this book outlines the evolution of typography for both serif and sans serif fonts. Each page was meticulously researched, created in InDesign, printed out (single sided and glued together), and sewn together.

## Accordian Book: *invisible string*
The accordian book features lyrics from *invisible string* by Taylor Swift. It is made entirely out of upcycled materials from our daily lives:
* The front and back covers are made from the instructional booklet of a COVID-19 test kit
* The wool is repurposed from the packaging of a vitamin bottle
* The sharp edge of a plastic knife leftover from a disposable utensils package was used as the paintbrush to write all the text
