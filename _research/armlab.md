**Challenge**
* Conducted research with the [Stanford Assistive Robotics and Manipulation Laboratory (ARMLab)](https://arm.stanford.edu) to develop a wearable sensor that can predict a person's path and stability, then alert them of possibile falls in real time. 
  * Intended users are older individuals who are at higher risk of instability and falls.
* Prior data collection setup involved multiple pieces of hardware. I aimed to simplify the setup by reducing the number of parts while maintaining performance.

**Action**
<!-- * Selected to participate in the Department of Mechanical Engineering 2023 Stanford Undergraduate Research Institute (SURI) as 1 of 30 undegraduate students for a 10 week research internship -->
* Developed an iOS application in Swift (programming language) that leverages the LiDAR sensor in iPhones to collect environment data and generate a depth panorama 
  * The depth panorama is used as input to a VAE + LSTM trajectory and sway prediction model


**Result**
* Application demo (below) shows the generation of the depth panorama in real time as a person walks down a hallway. The FPS on the screen needs to be multiplied by the number of GPUs (6 for the iPhone 12 Pro that the testing was conducted on)

* PyTorch prediction model has been converted to CoreML and will eventually be deployed on the iPhone for an integrated data collection and prediction process

**Research Presentations**
* **SURI Poster Session, August 2023**: Presented summer research progress to Stanford mechanical engineering labs and the SURI cohort
