## Project Overview
This project aimed to design a two-part glass crushing mechanism intended for crushing recycled glass bottles into a fine sand to be later repurposed for construction bricks. The project is for the Maa Trust in the Maasai Mara region, who aims to use the machine to create jobs and empower youth within the Mara. 

## Ideation and Prototyping
The first design involves a crank slider mechanism with a mathematical analysis into the viability of a bicycle powered system. The second design is an impact mill design using chains and powered by a diesel motor. The report includes our thought process, ideation and prototyping phase, as well as the design results and conclusions for future use of our product. Our conclusion was that the optimal design for a glass crusher that fits the Maa Trust’s requirements (durable, portable, repairable) was a two-part mechanism that first uses a crank slider to break the bottle into smaller parts before being grinded by the impact mill. Our conclusion also includes force analyses and power requirements. Having worked with the Maa Trust for two quarters, we’ve developed a strong relationship with the community and hope that our product and design can benefit future groups that continue on with this project. 

## User Requirements
Potential users are those who cannot physically reach down and those with limited range/mobility. Design considerations include:
* Lower required force to actuate the grasping mechanism 
* Light-weight and compact for everyday use and transportation 
* Long enough to reach over the constraints of any mobility aids
