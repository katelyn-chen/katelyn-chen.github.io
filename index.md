**I'm a Mechanical Engineering undergraduate at Stanford University** with an interest in assistive technology and robotics.<br>

I'm currently working as an **undergraduate researcher at the Assistive Robotics and Manipulation Lab (ARMLab)** under the guidance of [Professor Monroe Kennedy III](https://profiles.stanford.edu/monroe-kennedy) and Ken Wang on [trajectory and sway prediction for fall prevention](https://arm.stanford.edu/research/smart-belt-human-motion-prediction-and-fall-prevention-wearable-sensor).
 
Outside of classes, Iâ€™m involved with the Stanford Undergraduates for Mechanical Engineering (SUME), [Engineers for a Sustainable World (ESW)](https://eswstanford.weebly.com), and the [Stanford Solar Car Project (SSCP)](https://solarcar.stanford.edu). I am also working at the create:space maker space as a consultant.
