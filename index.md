I'm a **Mechanical Engineering undergraduate at Stanford University (concentration in Dynamic Systems and Controls)** with an interest in assistive technology, robotics, and design.<br>

I'm currently working as an **undergraduate researcher at the Assistive Robotics and Manipulation Lab (ARMLab)** on [trajectory and sway prediction for fall prevention](https://arm.stanford.edu/research/smart-belt-human-motion-prediction-and-fall-prevention-wearable-sensor) under the guidance of [Professor Monroe Kennedy III](https://profiles.stanford.edu/monroe-kennedy) and Ken Wang.
 
Outside of classes, Iâ€™m the President of the Stanford Undergraduates for Mechanical Engineering, International Project Lead for the [Engineers for a Sustainable World](https://eswstanford.weebly.com), and a Mechanical Team Member for the Stanford Solar Car Project (SSCP). I am also working at the create:space maker space as a consultant.
