I'm a **Mechanical Engineering student (B.S. and M.S.) at Stanford University** with an interest in assistive technology, robotics, and design. My undergraduate focus is on Dynamics Systems and Controls while my graduate focus is on Mechatronics. <br>

I'm currently working as an **undergraduate researcher at the Assistive Robotics and Manipulation Lab (ARMLab)** on [trajectory and sway prediction for fall prevention](https://arm.stanford.edu/research/smart-belt-human-motion-prediction-and-fall-prevention-wearable-sensor) under the guidance of Professor Monroe Kennedy III and Ken Wang.

I am also working as an **undergraduate researcher at the [Stanford Life Design Lab](http://lifedesignlab.stanford.edu)** to design and produce a Life Transitions Design Kit that complements the Designing Your Life curriculum, increasing the accessibility and reach of the life design process.

Outside of classes, I'm involved in...
