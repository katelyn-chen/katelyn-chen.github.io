## Design Goals
Design a device for those with limited mobility to grab items outside their reach. The device must be able to pick up a playing card without damage and a dime on a tile floor.

## User Requirements
Potential users are those who cannot physically reach down and those with limited range/mobility. Design considerations include:
* Lower required force to actuate the grasping mechanism 
* Light-weight and compact for everyday use and transportation 
* Long enough to reach over the constraints of any mobility aids
