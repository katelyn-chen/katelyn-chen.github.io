## Challenge
* Manually operated stamping machines face difficulties in its required force, precision, and universality.
* These machines need to produce consistent results with high precision while requiring low force for increased accessibility.
* I aimed to create a machine that operates using rotary motion and resets itself each time. All parts must be connected and approximately within 10’’ x 8’’ x 4’’.

## Action
* I conducted analysis on different rotary mechanisms and identified the scotch yoke as the most space efficient in converting linear motion into rotation. Using rapid prototyping, 
* I developed the device and created CAD assemblies to model the design and predicted motion.

## Result
* I used 3D printing and laser cutting to create a fully functional stamping machine that can be actuated with one hand. 
* I further developed my skills in prototyping and product realization through the integration of hardware and different materials. 
* I gained skills on GD&T, building the bill of materials, creating exploded assemblies, and creating intuitive designs.
