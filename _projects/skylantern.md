I designed and created from scratch a Taiwanese sky lantern inspired night light. I learned and executed machine shop skills such as machining, woodworking, welding, and sandcasting.

## Sand Casting
* I used Fusion 360 to design my pattern and iterated to compromise between draft angle, functionality, and aesthetics in CAD.
* The pattern was 3D printed in PLA in two parts with integrated fixturing holes on the base.
* The patternboard was created from scratch according to the size of the cope and drag.

## Machining (Mill)
* Steel tubes (0.375” OD, 0.065” wall thickness) were fishmouthed at 8.6º and 28.6º to form the frame of the lamp
* The sand cast base was machined to form the shallow recess for the lamp to sit in

## Welding
* 20 steel tubes were welded together using TiG welding with mild steel as the filler material.
