## Challenge
Experiment with print-in-place joints to create assemblies unique to additive manufacturing.

## Action
* Designed a Harry Potter inspired time turner with three rotating components. The entire assembly was one single print using five print-in-place joints. 
* Tested the tolerance of each joint through prototyping and practiced robust modeling techniques for quick iteration.

![Prototype 4](/assets/images/timeturner/proto4.png){:width="800"}

![Prototype 5](/assets/images/timeturner/proto5.png){:width="800"}

## Result
* Learned how to isolate components in CAD in order to only prototype critical parts and avoid printing the entire assembly every time. 
* From experimenting with the tolerances, I also learned that the dimensions of the joint can change the required offset distance.
