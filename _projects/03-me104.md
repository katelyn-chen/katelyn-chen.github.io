## Challenge
- Design a **lightweight, efficient transmission** to lift a 10kg weight on a lever by 10 cm using a maximum vertical mass drop of 2m. 
- Minimize system mass and mass drop while maintaining **structural integrity and mechanical efficiency**

## Action
- **Transmission Design:** Developed a two-stage gear system with two capstans to optimize force output and lever-lifting distance
  - Performed **inverse analysis and free body diagram calculations** to determine gear ratios, torque requirements, and capstan radii
  - Selected **acetal gears** for first stage and **PLA 3D-printed gears** for the second stage due to strength, mass efficiency, and manufacturability
  - Implemented MATLAB script to iterate face width, pitch, and gear teeth for **optimized gear strength and torque output**

</p>
- **Capstan Design:** Two PLA capstans with optimized radii (0.258’’ input, 0.163’’ output) to maintain **19:1 total transmission ratio**
  - Tapered geometry guides string toward the middle to reduce slipping and tension loss
  - Validated using **FEA**, ensuring sufficient factor of safety under lever-lifting loads (up to 200 N)

- **Acrylic Support Structure:** Mass-optimized 30 cm high laser-cut acrylic frame
  - Designed extended bottom leg and horizontal support beams to prevent tipping and bending
  - Central vertical beam in compression, right vertical beam in tension; fillets increased to reduce stress concentration
  - FEA confirmed stress distribution and stability under applied loads

</p>
- **Component Selection:**  
  - **Shafts:** 12L14 carbon steel, 3/16’’ and 5/16’’ diameters for strength and cost efficiency  
  - **Bearings:** Stainless steel flanged ball bearings, selected for dynamic load capacity and smooth rotation  
  - **Kevlar Strings:** Matched breaking strength to input/output loads, achieving safety factors of 2.9 (output) and 18 (input)  
  - Shaft collars to prevent axial movement and account for non-orthogonal loads  

## Result
- Built a **functional lever-lifting transmission system** with a 19:1 total gear ratio, achieving **10 cm lift with 2 kg mass drop**
