The goal of the project was to use algorithmic modeling tools to design a part unique to additive manufacturing that optimizes for weight without sacrificing performance.

## Ideation and Concept Sketches
* Mechanical Function: Hang over a surface and support weight without breaking
* User: Students living in dorms
* Use Case: People with lofted beds may find it difficult to turn off the light then navigate to their bed in the dark when going to sleep and also donâ€™t have anywhere to place their phone around the bed, so the hanging bedside table can hold a night light, phone, and earbuds.

## Force Analysis
Free body diagrams were used to determine the force that will be applied on the shelf.

## Prototyping (Algorithmic Modeling and Static Stress Simulation)
Three rounds of shape optimization was carried out before the first printed prototype:

![Shape Optimization Iteration](/assets/images/shelf/iterations.jpg){:width="800"}

Each promoted mesh had a mass ratio of around 40%. After the shape optimization, the design was updated to match the mesh. A static stress study is then used to verify the performance. These steps are repeated until the safety factor reaches ~5.

## Final Design
The final design had a safety factor of 5 under normal use and 2 under improper use (20N applied directly to the surface) and the mass was 35% of the original design.
