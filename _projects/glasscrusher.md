## Challenge
* Design a two-part glass crushing mechanism to crushing recycled glass bottles into fine sand for repurposing into bricks or beads 
* 6 month collaborative project between the Maa Trust and Engineers for the Sustainable World (ESW)
  * Intended to create jobs and empower youth in the Maasai Mara region

## Action
* Designed around user requirements, such as:
  * Materials widely available in the Maasai Mara
  * Powered only by diesel or solar power
  * Portable for use in different villages
  * Easily repairable for non-technically trained operators
* Conducted extensive research and interviews with locals in the Maasai Mara to validate the design
* Integrated a crank-and-slider with an impact mill to serve as primary and secondary crushing mechanisms respectively

## Result
* Focused on developing the impact mill and created a reduced-scale 3D printable model that could be replicated by the partner organizations in Kenya
* Validated the design through crushing potato chips and successfully crushed full chips into sand-like particles
