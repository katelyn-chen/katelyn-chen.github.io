We developed "The Plague's Gaze", a mechatronic arcade game where players must avoid being caught by the plague doctor and reach the end of the track. The game features mechanical components, sensors, and a PIC32 to create an interactive experience. We designed the complete game from scratch, including the SPI communication HAL, sourcing electronic components, defining and coding the event-based game logic, and designing all mechanical parts.
