## Stanford Assistive Robotics and Manipulation Laboratory (ARMLab)
**Trajectory and Sway Prediction for Fall Prevention**

Research Purpose:
*  "Develop a wearable sensor that can predict a person's path and their stability over the expected path, alerting them if there is a significant possibility they may fall or become unstable" ([Project Overview](https://arm.stanford.edu/research/smart-belt-human-motion-prediction-and-fall-prevention-wearable-sensor))
* Led by Monroe Kennedy III (PI) and Ken Wang (PhD researcher) in the [ARMLab](https://arm.stanford.edu)

My Role:
* Selected to participate in the 2023 Stanford Undergraduate Research Institute for Mechanical Engineering as 1/32 undegraduate students for a 10 week research internship
* Continuing to work in the ARMLab during the school year!

My Work:
* Developed an iOS application in Swift (programming language) that leverages the LiDAR sensor in iPhones to collect environment data and generate a depth panorama 
* Application demo (below) shows the generation of the depth panorama in real time as a person walks down a hallway. The FPS on the screen needs to be multiplied by the number of GPUs (6 for the iPhone 12 Pro that the testing was conducted on)

* The depth panorama is used as input to a VAE/LSTM trajectory and sway prediction model, which will eventually be deployed directly on the phone
* Currently working on deploying the PyTorch model in the iPhone and designing an ergonomic/aesthetically pleasing phone harness
